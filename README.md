## Introduction

A D flip-flop is a fundamental building block in digital circuits, commonly used for storing a single bit of data. This project verifies the functionality of a D flip-flop by:
1. Designing a simple D flip-flop module in SystemVerilog.
2. Creating a testbench to simulate and verify the DFF under various conditions.
3. Running simulations to ensure the DFF behaves as expected.


## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following tools:
- A SystemVerilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, VCS, or Xcelium)
- A waveform viewer (e.g., GTKWave or DVE) for analyzing simulation results

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishvas2129/d-flipflop-verification.git
   cd d-flipflop-verification
